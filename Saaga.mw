<!--The texts are [[Epic poetry|epic]] tales in [[prose]], often with stanzas or whole poems in [[alliterative verse]] embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, "tales of worthy men," who were often [[Vikings]], sometimes [[Norse paganism|Pagan]], sometimes [[Germanic Christianity|Christian]]. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.-->

<!--The term ''saga'' originates from the Icelandic ''saga ([[plural|pl.]] sögur''), and refers to (1)  "what is said, statement" or (2) "story, tale, history". It is cognate with the English word "say", and the [[German language|German]] ''sagen''. Icelandic sagas are based on oral traditions and much research has focused on what is real and what is fiction within each tale. The accuracy of the sagas is often hotly disputed. Most of the manuscripts in which the sagas are preserved were taken to [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] in the 17th century, but later returned to [[Iceland]]. 

There are plenty of tales of [[Monarch|kings]] (e.g. [[Heimskringla]]), every-day people (e.g. [[Bandamanna saga]]) and larger than life characters (e. g. [[Egils saga]]). The sagas describe a part of the history of some of the [[Nordic countries]] (e.g. the last chapter of [[Hervarar saga]]). The British Isles, northern France and North America are also mentioned. It was only recently (start of 20th century) that the tales of the voyages to America were authenticated.

Most sagas of [[Icelanders]] take place in the period 930&ndash;1030, which is called ''[[söguöld]]'' (Age of the Sagas) in Icelandic history. The sagas of kings, bishops, contemporary sagas have their own time frame.  Most were written down between 1190 to 1320, sometimes existing as oral traditions long before, others are pure fiction, and for some we do know the sources: the author of King [[Sverrir]]'s saga had met the king and used him as a source.-->

Norse sagas are generally classified as: the [[Kings' sagas]] (''Konungasögur''), [[Icelanders' sagas]] (''Íslendinga sögur''), [[Short tales of Icelanders]] (''Íslendingaþættir''), [[Contemporary sagas]] (''Samtíðarsögur'' or ''Samtímasögur''), [[Legendary sagas]] (''Fornaldarsögur''), [[Chivalric sagas]] (''Riddarasögur'') and [[Saga of the Greenlanders]] (''Grœnlendingasögur'').

The Kings' Sagas are of the lives of Scandinavian [[monarch|king]]s. They were composed in the 12th to 14th centuries. The Icelanders' sagas (''Íslendinga sögur'') are heroic prose narratives written in the 12th to 14th centuries of the great families of Iceland from 930 to 1030. These are the highest form of the classical Icelandic saga writing.  Some well-known examples include [[Njáls saga]], [[Laxdœla saga]] and ''[[Grettis saga]]''. The material of the Short tales of Icelanders  sagas is similar to ''Íslendinga sögur'', in shorter form. The narratives of the Contemporary Sagas are set in 12th- and 13th-century Iceland, and were written soon after the events they describe. Most are preserved in the compilation ''[[Sturlunga saga]]''. The Legendary Sagas blend remote history with myth or legend. The aim is on a lively narrative and entertainment. Scandinavia's pagan past was a proud and heroic history for the Icelanders. The Chivalric Sagas are translations of Latin pseudo-historical works and French [[chansons de geste]] as well as native creations in the same style.-->

<!--Through the centuries, the word ''saga'' has gained a broader meaning in Nordic languages. In contemporary Swedish and Danish it describes a non-realistic or [[epic]] work of fiction. ''Folksaga'' means [[folk tale]]; a [[fairy tale]] by an unknown author, in Swedish and Danish. ''Konstsaga'' is the Swedish term for a fairy tale by a known author, such as [[H. C. Andersen]] or [[Astrid Lindgren]], while the Danish and Norwegian term is ''eventyr'' ("adventure"). A ''saga'' can also be a work of [[fantasy fiction]]. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' series was translated to Swedish by [[Åke Ohlmarks]] by the title ''Sagan om ringen'': "The Saga of the Ring". Tolkien knew enough Swedish to be dissatisfied with the Swedish title (and the translation work in general), and the 2004 translation was titled ''Ringarnas herre'', a literal translation from the original.

In Swedish history, the term ''sagokung'', "saga king" is intended to be ambiguous, as it describes the [[semi-legendary kings of Sweden]], who are known only from unreliable, probably fictional, sources.-->
