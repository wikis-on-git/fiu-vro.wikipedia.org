Qin Shi Huangdi remains a controversial figure in Chinese history. After unifying China, he and his chief adviser [[Li Si]] passed a series of major economic and political reforms.<ref name="duik" /> He undertook gigantic projects, including the first version of the [[Great Wall of China]], the now famous city-sized [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|mausoleum]] guarded by a life-sized [[Terracotta Army]], and a massive national road system, all at the expense of many lives. To ensure stability, Qin Shi Huang outlawed [[Confucianism]] and [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|buried many scholars alive]].<ref name="Ren" /> All books other than those officially decreed were banned and burned in what is known as the [[great Confucian purge]]. Despite the [[tyranny]] of his [[autocratic]] rule, Qin Shi Huang is regarded as a pivotal figure.
