'''Kildamäng''' e. puslõ om mäng, kon tulõ pall'o väiksit, tihtipääle viguridsõ kujoga, kilda kokko sobitadaq. Ega killu pääl om väikene tükükene määntsestki pildist; noidõ kokkosobitamisõl saias suur' pilt'. 



Jigsaw puzzles were originally created by painting a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces with a jigsaw, hence the name. John Spilsbury, a London mapmaker and engraver, is credited with creating the first jigsaw puzzle around 1760.



Most modern jigsaw puzzles are made out of cardboard, since they are easier and cheaper to mass produce. An enlarged photograph or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional artwork is then glued onto the cardboard before cutting. The pieces are punch-cut with complex metal dies.

Typical images found on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from nature, buildings, and repetitive designs. Castles and mountains are two traditional subjects.
